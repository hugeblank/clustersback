Fabric mod for Java Minecraft that backports the raw iron/gold clusters and blocks of 1.17+ to 
1.16.5!

This mod depends on the Fabric API, and an internet connection on first launch. 

This mod was a commission for [zagxc](https://twitch.tv/zagxc). With his permission, this mod has 
been licensed and distributed under the MIT for your pleasure.


## FAQ

Q: Why do I need an internet connection on first launch?

A: It's against Minecraft's EULA to distribute game assets. In order to bypass this we have to 
download an entire version of the game on launch. See the next question for more details on how 
that works.

Q: Isn't this against the EULA?

A: Nope! At least not the way I've done it here. On launch:
1. 1.18.2 is downloaded from the same place that the game launcher downloads it from
2. It's put in the users config directory (see `GAME_DIR/config/clustersback`)
3. The textures, loot tables, and recipes, are all loaded from that cached version of the game.

Therefore! Since it does not directly distribute any assets from the game, it is perfectly legal.

Q: Why does this mod exist?

A: The person that commissioned this mod dislikes deepslate. The last version that didn't have 
any deepslate was... 1.16.5.
